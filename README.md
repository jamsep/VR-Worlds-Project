# To Rise Once More

Created a VR experience in Unity for a VR design course


## How it works

The player is a gorilla whose main method of movement is by slamming the ground (using GorillaLocomotion https://github.com/Another-Axiom/GorillaLocomotion)

The game is built upon the foundation of it being an "experience", thus there is no proper objective for the player to take.

However, the player is able to climb a tree which grows as they grab a fruit.



- Scene is still unoptimized and thus running this natively on VR headsets such as the Quest will not run well
